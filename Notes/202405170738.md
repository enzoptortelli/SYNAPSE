## Sobre o método
> Basing cluster analysis on a probability model has several advantages. In essence, this brings cluster analysis within the range of standard statistical methodology and makes it possible to carry out inference in a principled way

> Basing cluster analysis on a probability model also leads to a way of assessing uncertainty about the clustering. In addition, it provides a systematic way of dealing with outliers by expanding the model to account for them.

> It also provides a principled way to choose the number of clusters. In fact, the choice of clustering model and of number of clusters can be reduced to a single model selection problem. It turns out that there is a trade-off between these choices. Often, if a simpler clustering model is chosen, more clusters are needed to represent the data adequately.

> Data generated by mixtures of multivariate normal densities are characterized by groups or clusters centered at the means μg , with increased density for points nearer the mean.

==Falar sobre como o número de parâmetros do modelo que devemos estimar cresce rapidamente com o número de variáveis que estamos usando. Manter na cabeça a palavra PARSIMONIA==

> However, it has (G − 1) + Gd + G{d(d + 1)/2} parameters, and this can be quite a large number

> Such large numbers of parameters can lead to difficulties in estimation, including lack of precision or even degeneracies. They can also lead to difficulties in interpreting the results.

> e results. In order to alleviate this problem, it is common to specify more parsimonious versions of the model. One way to do this is via the eigenvalue decomposition of the group covariance matrices Σg , in the form Σg = λg Dg Ag DT g . (2.3)
