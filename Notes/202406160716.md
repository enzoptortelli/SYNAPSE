> A network is any data set that is composed of nodes (or actors) upon which we have relational data recorded for each pair of nodes.

> The network is said to be undirected if yij = yji for all pairs (i, j), otherwise the network is said to be directed.

> he layout of the nodes can also be shown using a force-directed layout (Figure 10.2), where the location of the nodes is chosen so that connected nodes tend to be adjacent and non-connected nodes are distant. In this case, the Fruchtermanâ€“Reingold force-based algorithm (Fruchterman and Reingold, 1991) is used as implemented in the network (Butts et al., 2014) R package.
